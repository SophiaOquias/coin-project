1. To access the tutorial page, open ```tutorial.html```. This is just to familiarize participants with keyboard-only navigation before proceeding to the actual experiment.
2. Run ```randomize.py``` in the CMD to randomize the order of the cards before displaying the prototype to participants.
3. To view the prototype, open ```index.html```. For blind participants, Window's built-in Narrator is to be used as the screen reader.


The following tasks were assigned to all participants:
* Go to the safety glasses 
* Go to the utility knife

The raw data/results of the experiments can be found in ```[HCI2001] Experiment Results.xlsx```.
